# Blue-Green Deployments using Argo Rollouts

This article uses Open Shift GitOps to deploy the Argo Rollouts progressive delivery controller. It walks through a Blue-Green deployment.

Blue-Green Deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments, only one of which (blue) serves production traffic at any time. After the new version (green) is deployed and tested, traffic is switched from the blue environment to the green environment.
